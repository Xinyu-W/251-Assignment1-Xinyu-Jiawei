### Division of labor:

Xinyu Wang,of course,did the bigger part. We discussed a lot about this. According to what he says,he searched a lot,read their source code and finally developed his own style.

Jiawei Feng,did the respectively hard part : search and Git,the complex branch and merges are done by him. And he develop a search window,which took him two days.(He's really not good at Java)

### Problems we met

Git,a management system which is a bit difficult to get started with. We learned commit,branch,merge,reset,pull and push.

Search once got a bug that don's display name.
